## 1. Installation

### Composer (recommended)

```bash
composer require mage2kishan/module-order-attachments
bin/magento module:enable Panth_Core Panth_OrderAttachments
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento setup:di:compile
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f
bin/magento cache:flush
```

### Manual zip

1. Download the extension package zip
2. Extract to `app/code/Panth/OrderAttachments`
3. Make sure `app/code/Panth/Core` is also present
4. Run the same `module:enable ... cache:flush` commands above

---

## 2. Verifying the extension is active

After installation, these should work:

1. **Configuration page** — Stores > Configuration > Panth Extensions > Order Attachments is reachable
2. **Admin grid** — Sales > Panth Infotech > Order Attachments is reachable
3. **Product attribute** — edit any product and look for the "Order Attachments" attribute group

If any of these fail, see [Troubleshooting](#9-troubleshooting).

---

Navigate to **Stores > Configuration > Panth Extensions > Order Attachments**.

## 4. Enabling attachments on products

Attachments are opt-in per product:

1. Open **Catalog > Products > Edit Product**

3. Set **Allow Order Attachments** to **Yes**
4. Save the product

Only products with this attribute set to Yes will show the upload
widget on their product page.

## 5. How customers use it

### Product page

When a product has attachments enabled, a drag-and-drop upload zone
appears below the product options:

1. Customer drags files or clicks "browse" to select files
2. Files upload immediately via AJAX with progress bars
3. Image files show thumbnail previews; other files show type badges
4. Customer can optionally add a note (up to 500 characters)
5. Customer can remove files before adding to cart
6. When the customer clicks "Add to Cart", the attachment IDs are
   submitted with the form

### Cart

Uploaded attachments appear as a styled card under the product in the
cart (Hyva) or as plain text (Luma), showing thumbnails, filenames,
and any customer note.

### Cart edit

When a customer edits cart item options, the existing attachments are
pre-loaded. The customer can add more, remove some, or update the note.

### Checkout

Attachment info is visible in the checkout order summary.

### After order placement

Attachments are linked to the order. On the "My Orders > View Order"
page, grouped attachment cards are shown with:
- Thumbnail or file-type badge
- Filename, extension, and file size
- Customer note (if provided)
- Download link

---

## 6. Admin order view

Open any order in **Sales > Orders > View**.

An **Order Attachments** section appears showing a table with:
- File name (with icon)
- Product (linked to product edit page)
- Size
- Type (extension badge)
- Uploaded by (customer email or "Guest")
- Note
- Date
- Download action

---

## 7. Admin attachments grid

Navigate to **Sales > Panth Infotech > Order Attachments**.

The grid shows all attachments across all orders with columns:
- Thumbnail (image preview or file-type badge)
- Original Filename
- Product Name (linked to product edit page)
- Order ID
- Customer Email
- File Size (formatted)
- File Extension
- Status
- Created At / Updated At
- Actions (Download)

The grid supports filtering, sorting, and export.

---

## 8. Customer order view

On the storefront, customers can view their attachments on the
**My Orders > View Order** page. Each product's attachments are
grouped together with thumbnails, download links, and notes.

Image attachments open in a lightbox when clicked.

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Upload widget not showing | Product attribute not set to Yes | Edit product > Order Attachments > Allow Order Attachments = Yes |

| Upload fails with "file type not allowed" | Extension not in the allowed list | Stores > Configuration > Upload > Allowed Extensions |
